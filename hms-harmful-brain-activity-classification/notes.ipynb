    "1. **B-1:** Rhythmic delta activity with admixed sharp discharges. Spectrogram suggests tail end of a seizure. Disagreement between SZ and “Other”.\n",
    "2. **B-2:** Frontal lateralized sharp transients at ~1Hz with reversed polarity, likely non-cerebral source. Split between LPD and “Other” (artifact).\n",
    "3. **B-3:** Diffused semi-rhythmic delta background with low amplitude generalized periodic discharges, shifting morphology, proto-GPD type pattern.\n",
    "4. **B-4:** Semi-rhythmic delta activity with unstable morphology over the right hemisphere, proto-LRDA pattern.\n",

    "5. **B-5:** Rhythmic delta activity with unstable morphology, poorly sustained, proto-GRDA.\n",
    "6. **C-1:** 2Hz LPDs showing evolution with increasing amplitude, pattern between LPDs and seizure onset, edge-case.\n",
    "7. **D-1:** Abundant GPDs on suppressed background, frequency 1-2Hz, average ~1.5Hz, suggesting a seizure, edge-case.\n",
    "8. **C-2:** Split between LPDs and GPDs, higher amplitude discharges on the right.\n",

    "- **SIRPIDs**: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic, Periodic, or Ictal Discharges\n",
    "  - Common in prolonged EEG monitoring, especially in critically ill patients.\n",
    "  - Associated with conditions like hypoxic injury, traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and toxic-metabolic disturbances.\n",
    "  - Can be linked to spontaneous electrographic seizures.\n",
    "  - [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29718832/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-PDs**: Stimulus-Induced Periodic Discharges\n",
    "  - Specific EEG patterns induced by stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-RDA**: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic Delta Activity\n",
    "  - Rhythmic activity in the delta frequency band induced by a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-SW**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Sharp Waves\n",
    "  - Sharp waves observed in response to a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-bursts**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Bursts\n",
    "  - Bursts of electrical activity seen in response to a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-IIC**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Irregular Intermittent Complexes\n",
    "  - Irregular, intermittent complex discharges in response to stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-BIRDS**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Brief Ictal Rhythmic Discharges\n",
    "  - Brief, seizure-like rhythmic discharges triggered by a stimulus.\n",

    "These EEG patterns are critical in interpreting the neurological state of patients, particularly those who are critically ill or have specific neurological conditions. They provide valuable information for treatment decisions"
