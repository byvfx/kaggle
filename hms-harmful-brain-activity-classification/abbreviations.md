### EEG Pattern Abbreviations and Their Meanings

- **SIRPIDs**: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic, Periodic, or Ictal Discharges
  - Common in prolonged EEG monitoring, especially in critically ill patients.
  - Associated with conditions like hypoxic injury, traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and toxic-metabolic disturbances.
  - Can be linked to spontaneous electrographic seizures.

- **SI-PDs**: Stimulus-Induced Periodic Discharges
  - Specific EEG patterns induced by stimuli.

- **SI-RDA**: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic Delta Activity
  - Rhythmic activity in the delta frequency band induced by a stimulus.

- **SI-SW**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Sharp Waves
  - Sharp waves observed in response to a stimulus.

- **SI-bursts**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Bursts
  - Bursts of electrical activity seen in response to a stimulus.

- **SI-IIC**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Irregular Intermittent Complexes
  - Irregular, intermittent complex discharges in response to stimuli.

- **SI-BIRDS**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Brief Ictal Rhythmic Discharges
  - Brief, seizure-like rhythmic discharges triggered by a stimulus.

These EEG patterns are critical in interpreting the neurological state of patients, particularly those who are critically ill or have specific neurological conditions. They provide valuable information for treatment decisions.
