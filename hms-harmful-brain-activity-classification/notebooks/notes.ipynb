    "- **SIRPIDs**: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic, Periodic, or Ictal Discharges\n",
    "  - Common in prolonged EEG monitoring, especially in critically ill patients.\n",
    "  - Associated with conditions like hypoxic injury, traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and toxic-metabolic disturbances.\n",
    "  - Can be linked to spontaneous electrographic seizures.\n",
    "  - [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29718832/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-PDs**: Stimulus-Induced Periodic Discharges\n",
    "  - Specific EEG patterns induced by stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-RDA**: Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic Delta Activity\n",
    "  - Rhythmic activity in the delta frequency band induced by a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-SW**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Sharp Waves\n",
    "  - Sharp waves observed in response to a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-bursts**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Bursts\n",
    "  - Bursts of electrical activity seen in response to a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SI-IIC**: Likely Stimulus-Induced Irregular Intermittent Complexes\n",
    "  - Irregular, intermittent complex discharges in response to stimuli.\n",
